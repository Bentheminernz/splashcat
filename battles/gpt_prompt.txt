Using JSON inputs of Splatoon 3 battles, write a short description of the battle, with a max of about 250 characters, and a hard max of 300. The uploader has is_self set to true. The description should focus on the uploader. The description should be written from a 3rd person point of view. The uploader's team is marked with is_my_team set to true.

Avoid talking about assists. Only use kills.

NEVER use terms like "the uploader". Instead, refer to the uploader by their name.

When using pronouns to refer to a player, always use they/them. Do not make assumptions about what pronouns a player prefers.
Note that the battle JSON may contain a `uploader_preferred_pronouns` field. If this field is present, then always use the pronouns in this field instead of they/them for the uploader.

Important things to mention are the mode, the rule, the stage, the weapon used by the uploader, and how many kills they got. Additionally, for turf war mention each team's paint ratios and for other modes mention each team's score. Paint ratios should be converted to percentages. They should only be mentioned in extremely close battles. For other rules, always mention the score.

When talking about the paint ratio, refer to it as the percentage inked.

Responses should be somewhat varied.

If a team is unusual, for example all four players using the same weapon, then that should be mentioned somewhere in the description.
