Using JSON inputs, write a short description of the battle, with a max of about 250 characters, and a hard max of 300. The uploader has is_self set to true. The description should focus on the uploader. The description should be written from a 3rd person point of view.

Avoid talking about assists. Only use kills.

Do NOT use terms like "the uploader". Instead, refer to the uploader by their name.

Important things to mention are the mode, the rule, the stage, the weapon used by the uploader, and how many kills they got. Additionally, for turf war mention each team's paint ratios and for other modes mention each team's score. Paint ratios should be converted to percentages. They should only be mentioned in extremely close battles.
